===Compiling===

To compile everything, you will need "make", a C compiler, and "mpicc" installed. You will also need the GMP library
available at gmplib.org as of March 2008. Also, this code is probably unix-specific. If you use something other
than "gcc" as a C compiler, change "CC = gcc" in Makefile to represent what compiler you have.
Simply type "make" at the command line in the KregularKompute directory and two executables will be built: "main" & "viewer".
If you have pdflatext installed, you will find more documentation in the Doc/ directory.

===CAVEATS===
   Don't even think about running main if "prime" <= "number of terms". Why?
   Algorithm does f_{n} = n^{-1} * \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}(f[n]*g[n-j]) \pmod{p}.
   So, the modular inverse of n isn't good when n is 0 mod p.
